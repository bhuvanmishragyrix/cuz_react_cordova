  <meta name='description' content='An Android and iOS mobile application which allows users to register their email, verify it, login. Then select a product category (e.g. Dirtbike), select a brand, a year and a model. Choose a customisable graphic (a set of stickers for different parts of the product) from the available list of graphics. Customise the colors of the selected graphic (customise colors of different stickers of different parts of the product), preview the changes as they would appear on the right side of the product (e.g. on the right side of Dirtbike), reset the colors of graphics (reset colors of different stickers of different parts of products) to defaults. Once completed you can view a summary of the graphic you are about to purchase, along with the price. Enter your personal details (Name, City, Country, Phone) and finally make a payment by using a credit or debit card. Your printable customized graphic will be sent to the admin and you will be returned with a reference number, and a receipt of the payment will be sent to your registered email. '>

  <ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>This (src/index.js) is the entry point of the application.</li>
<li>Here we first lock the orientation of the device to portrait. </li>
<li>Then wait for 100ms (had to do this else the orientation wasn't getting locked to portrait).</li>
<li>Then we render the application (src/App.js) at the div with id "root" (which is present inside index.html).</li>
<li>We write code inside "src/". After we have completed we run "npm run build", our build workflow (webpack) then bundles all the files inside "www" folder. The folder structure of src is as follows: </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> "assets" - Contains assets such as font files and the logo. </li>
<li> "awsLambdaPaymentFunction" - Contents of the folder are to be zipped and uploaded on AWS Lambda (lambdaFunc.zip is the zipped file that was uploaded). </li>
<li> "containers" - Contains the components which are acting as just containers. They just contain other components. </li>
<li> "components" - This is the folder which contains the different react component which are used in the application. </li>
<li> "constants" - Contains a file AppConstants.js, where all the constants used in the application are defined. </li>
<li> "store" - Contains all the files related to the store (redux), including reducer.js and actionTypes.js. </li>
<li> "util" - Contains the AWS code that manages users (AWSUserManagement.js), the AWS code that manages other AWS services. Contains the JSON file (CUZProductsAndImagesData.json) which contains the data (inside "images" attribute) of each image which is present inside the application. For each image used inside the application there should be an entry in the "images" attribute of this file. Also it contains the price of respective graphics. The file is to be uploaded on S3. The "namesForReference" attribute is just for reference and contains the attributes that must be in each object of the images array. The "Util.js" file contains utility functions that are used application wide.</li>
<li> "index.css" - Contains the css code that is globally to be used in the application.</li>
<li> "App.js" - This is the root component of our application.</li>
<li> "index.html" - This is the file where our bundled code (from webpack is finally attached.). The stripe script has to be hosted here. This script should always be loaded directly from https://js.stripe.com:  </li>
